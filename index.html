    <h1>Digits: Koston</h1>
    <p>
        A few months back, I made excellent use of my time and <a href="http://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2019/07/31/statistical-analysis-every-jim-greco-clip/">analyzed the skating in all the major video parts of Jim Greco.</a>. Well I'm back again, Jenkem fans, and this time we're going to look at  one of skateboarding's undisputable G.O.A.T.s: the ineffable Eric Koston.
        <br><br>
        Whether you love him for his on-the-board prowess or hate him for his off-the-board deportment, you can't deny the impact of Koston, through his video parts, has had on skateboarding. 
        As usual, our goal is to appreciate our skater in a new light, by digging deeper into their video parts, and answer the questions that really matter: what tricks do they do? What do they do them on?  into these iconic video parts, t and hopefully tease apart something interesting. So let's get to it.
        <br><br>
    <p>

    <h1>Top Tricks</h1>
    <p>
        Most iconic skaters have their trick: Andrew Reynolds has the frontside flip. Erik Ellington has the backside bigspin. And Todd Falcon has the Falcon flip. While Koston obviously has a massive bag of tricks, very rarely do you see him do the same trick twice. This is reflected in his top tricks, where no "favorite" exists. His most popular trick, the kickflip, is done a mere ten times:
    </p>
    <!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->
    <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
    <p>
        This lack-of-favorite is driven home even more when we compare the results to Greco's, who had less tricks done overall (todo vs todo) yet had multiple 'favorite' tricks. despite having TODO less tricks overall, had a much higher proportion of repeat tricks. On the other hand, Koston's most popular trick occurs a mere ten times If anything, this speaks to the talents of Koston - the dude is so good and has such an arsenal of tricks at his disposal that he doesn't need to repeart anything - he just does what he wants. 
    </p>

    <h1>Obstacles Skated Over The Years</h1>

    <p>
        Most skaters change the way they skate over time. Sometimes they get older and their bodies change. Sometimes they find a new way to enjoy skating.  Other times they just get over it. Whatever, it's natural.
        <br><br>
         Koston is no different, and his skating has gone through its share of evolutions over the years:  
    </p>


    <div id="obstacles"></div>
    <p>
        Early on, Koston.
        TODO add comments
    </p>
    <h1>Number of Tricks</h1>
    <p>
        Koston's skating has evolved over time. So too has his output. In terms of clips filmed, Koston's best part is ___ and his weakest is ___. Looking at the overall number of tricks, we see his best part is ____, and that his output, for the most part, increase over time, with the 'peak' of his career occurring between todo 2000-20000. The "% Distinct Tricks" column tells us the proportion of tricks in the video part that were unique, i.e. unrepeated. The numbers are very high, and many are 100%, reflecting our earlier hypothesis that Koston doesn't repeat much. What a G.

    <h1 class="centered goth">Koston: Percentages</h1>

     <p>
        I have been manipulating some data frames, but unfortunately I have two percentage columns, one in the format '61.72' and the other '0.62'.

        I want to just divide the column with the percentages in the '61.72' format by 100 then round it to 2.dp so it is consistent with the data frame.

        Is there an easy way of doing this?

        My data frame has two columns, one called 'A' and the other 'B', I want to format 'B'.

        Many thanks!
