  <h1>Digits: Koston</h1>
  <p>
    A few months back, I made excellent use of my time and <a
      href="http://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2019/07/31/statistical-analysis-every-jim-greco-clip/">analyzed the skating in
      all the major video parts of Jim Greco.</a>. Well I'm back again, Jenkem fans, and this time we're going to look
    at one of skateboarding's undisputable G.O.A.T.s: the ineffable Eric Koston.
    <br><br>
    Whether you love him for his on-the-board prowess or hate him for his off-the-board deportment, you can't deny the
    impact of Koston, through his video parts, has had on skateboarding.
    As usual, our goal is to appreciate our skater in a new light, by digging deeper into their video parts, and answer
    the questions that really matter: what tricks do they do? What do they do them on? into these iconic video parts, t
    and hopefully tease apart something interesting. So let's get to it.
    <br><br>
    <p>

      <h1>Top Tricks</h1>
      <p>
        Our views of a particular skater are largely shaped by the tricks that they do, with many iconic skaters having their own sort of signature trick. Andrew Reynolds has the frontside flip. Erik Ellington has the backside bigspin. Todd Falcon has the Falcon flip (don't hate). Yet, despite being one of the most iconic skateboarders of all time, Koston has no obvious calling card when it comes to trick selection. He rarely repeats the same tricks. This is reflected in his top tricks, where no clear favorite exists, although switch heelflip and kickflip managed to claw their way to the top:
      </p>
      <!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->
      <div id="my_dataviz"></div>
      <p> 
        Rather than doing a few tricks many times, Koston does many tricks with lower frequencies. 
        <br><br>
        This lack-of-favorite is driven home even more when we compare the results to Greco's, who  despite having done less tricks overall, had a much higher proportion of repeated tricks, with the highest occurring almost forty times. Koston's most popular trick, on the other hand, occurs a mere ten times. 
        <br><br>
        I think this reflects two main things. First, and most obvious, Koston is very good at skateboarding. He has a such a large number of diverse tricks for the simple fact that he can. Second, Koston puts a lot of thought into his video parts, and is conscious of the tricks he's done and will include in a given video part. 
      </p>

      <h1>Top Tricks By Obstacle</h1>
      <p>
        We can break down Koston's trick selection to a <i>slightly</i> more granular level, and view the tricks he's done across different obstacles. Interestingly, five of his top eight flatground tricks involve a change of stance, something he often does in lines. In an amusing, almost comical token to Koston's skill: he does nollie heelflip noseslides as often as he does 50-50s on rails.

      <h1>Obstacles Skated Over The Years</h1>
      <p>
        Of course, part of Koston's greatness 

        Most skaters change the way they skate over time. Sometimes they get older and their bodies change. Sometimes
        they find a new way to enjoy skating. Other times they just get over it. Whatever, it's natural.
        <br><br>
        Koston is no different, and his skating has gone through its share of evolutions over the years:

        Early on, Koston.
        TODO add comments
      </p>
      <h1>Number of Tricks</h1>
      <p>
        Koston has had a long and healthy career, and while his output as slowed over time, he still appears fairly often in videos. The videos included for this analysis are listed in the table below - they represent his core output, his career signature, so to speak.

        In all but two videos, Menkimati and Chronicles, Koston has a larger number of tricks than clips, indicating that a large number of lines were filmed. (The reverse, having more clips than tricks, indicates multiple repeat angles).

        The <i>% Distinct Tricks</i> column tells us the proportion of tricks in that video part that were unique. E.g., a video with a value of 100% will have no repeat tricks at all, so at most one kickflip, one boardslide, etc. A typical value for most skateboarders will likely fall around 30-60%. Koston, averages 90.7%. A simplified interpretation of this is that, when Koston does <i>any trick</i> in a video part (such as a flatground kickflip or 360 flip), there's less than a 10% chance, on average, that he'll do that same trick again in the video, <i>in any capacity</i>. This interpretation is a bit simplified - Koston has a few tricks he's more likely to repeat than others, but you get the gist: Koston doesn't repeat tricks much.

        Koston's skating has evolved over time. So too has his output. In terms of clips filmed, Koston's best part is
        ___ and his weakest is ___. Looking at the overall number of tricks, we see his best part is ____, and that his
        output, for the most part, increase over time, with the 'peak' of his career occurring between todo 2000-20000.
        The "% Distinct Tricks" column tells us the proportion of tricks in the video part that were unique, i.e.
        unrepeated. The numbers are very high, and many are 100%, reflecting our earlier hypothesis that Koston doesn't
        repeat much. What a G.

      <h1 class="centered goth">Koston: Percentages</h1>

      <p>
        To get a better idea of the diversity of Koston's career, we can look at a per-video breakdown of what he does. Each square below is made up of one-hundred points, with each point representing one percent. In this manner, we can compare how the composition of tricks in each of Koston's videos differs.
        In general, Koston has a slight preference for bs tricks over fs tricks. Surprisingly, the video with the highest percentage of slow-motion tricks was <i>not</i> Fully Flared, it was Menikmati. Thanks for holding back, Ty.

        I have been manipulating some data frames, but unfortunately I have two percentage columns, one in the format

        I want to just divide the column with the percentages in the '61.72' format by 100 then round it to 2.dp so it
        is consistent with the data frame.

        Is there an easy way of doing this?

        My data frame has two columns, one called 'A' and the other 'B', I want to format 'B'.

      <h1>Data & Methodology</h1>
      <p>
        Skate video information was hand-logged from the full-length video parts of Eric Koston.  

        Although Koston has appeared in a multitude of skate videos over time, we've limited the set of data to include only his full-length video parts. These are more in-line with what people consider when they look at the "career" of the skater.
